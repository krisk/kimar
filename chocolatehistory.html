                                      established before A.D. 1000. One Zontli equalled 400 cocoa beans, while 8000 beans
                                      equalled one Xiquipilli. In Mexican picture scripts a basket with 8000 beans represents

                                      more tolerant towards the exquisite beverage. The question of the fast took on a
                                      new urgency. In 1662, Cardinal Brancaccio hands down the judgment of Solomon:"Liquidum
                                      non fragit jejunum." In other words:"Liquids (in the form of chocolate) do not break
                                      the fast." Clearly, one had to wait until Easter to indulge in the eating of chocolate.

                                      Spain, formerly the classic land of chocolate, falls far behind. Germany takes the
                                      lead in consumption per head, followed by the United States, France and Great Britain.
                                      In just a decade or two another country will be playing first violin in the orchestra
                                      of the chocolate nations - Switzerland. The reputation of Swiss chocolate, bolstered
                                      by unbroken series of medals at international exhibitions, has not only fallen upon
                                      the ears of foreigners. It has also conquered Swiss palates. Like bratwurst, rösti
                                      and fondue, chocolate has become a national dish.
